  <h2> How it all began? </h2>
</header>

<p>
My love for programming began when I took an introductory course in Java the summer before my senior year in high school.
<br> </br>
Exposed to a different aspect of technology, I became increasingly interested in a world where I could create anything by writing my own programs that could solve problems, each serving its own purpose.

<p>
I value loyalty and strive for optimism.
<br> </br>
I have a penchant for planning/organizing (Google Calendar is my go-to).
<br> </br>
I'm fond of pastels and desserts.
<br> </br>
I listen to music basically all the time.
<br> </br>
I'm a huge fan of the growth mindset and personal improvement.
<br> </br>
I love education & teaching.
