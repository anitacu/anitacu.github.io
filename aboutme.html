      <h2> How it all began? </h2>
    </header>

    <p>
    My love for programming began when I took an introductory course in Java the summer after my junior year in high school.
    <br> </br>
    Exposed to a different aspect of technology, I became increasingly interested in a world where I could create my own programs that could solve problems and serve its own purpose.
    <br> </br>
    Ever since then, I've tried my best to expand my knowledge in programming by learning more languages, including Python, Scheme, and SQL,
    as well as learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a personal website (such as this one!!).

    <p>
    I value loyalty and strive for optimism.
    <br> </br>
    I have a penchant for planning/organizing (Google Calendar is my go-to).
    <br> </br>
    I'm fond of pastels and desserts.
    <br> </br>
    I'm a huge fan of the growth mindset and personal improvement.
    <br> </br>
    I love education & teaching.
